# jsNodePlotter
NodeJS backend providing live data collected from a sensor (currently only mockup) and AngularJS app plotting these data. For this project, following technologies were used:
- Node.js as a server host. 
- socket.io for socket communication 
- mongoDB - database engine as data storage for sensors' data
- AngularJS - frontpage SPA to visualise data
- babel - JS ECMA2016 -> 2015 transpiler (for VS Code debugging)
- nvd3, plotly - ploting libraries 

##Getting started
The main aim of the project was to create wrappable and customizable live plotting module, which could be used as a part of bigger projects.

###Prerequisites
1. MongoDB - database engine must be installed on the dev/prod machine
2. VS Code - efficient tool not only for code editing but also convinient node.js debugger
3. node - to run application and access npm repo
